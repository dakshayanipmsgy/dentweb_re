No budget has been deployed, and no leads have been generated.\n**Diagnosis:** There is a disconnect between the channel strategy (Facebook/Instagram) and the asset library (0 channel assets). We cannot launch without creative material.\n**Immediate Goal:** Create ad creatives, finalize targeting, and move the campaign to \"Active\" within 48 hours to utilize the ₹10,000 budget for initial market validation in Ranchi.\n\n### Online actions\n1.  **Create 3 Ad Creatives (Urgent):** You currently have 0 assets for FB/Insta. Immediate requirement:\n    *   **Creative A (Trust):** Photo of a completed Dakshayani installation in Jharkhand with the text \"Solarize your home in Ranchi.\"\n    *   **Creative B (Savings):** A graphic showing an electricity bill drop (e.g., \"Reduce bills by 90%\").\n    *   **Creative C (Subsidy):** A bold graphic highlighting the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana subsidy benefits.\n2.  **Launch Campaign with \"WhatsApp\" Objective:** Since you have a \"WhatsApp pack\" ready, configure the Facebook Ad Set to **Traffic > WhatsApp** or **Leads > WhatsApp**. This reduces friction and allows immediate conversation.\n3.  **Refine Targeting:**\n    *   **Location:** Ranchi (+15km radius).\n    *   **Age:** 30–60 (Homeowner demographic).\n    *   **Interests:** Solar power, Sustainable energy, Home construction, Real estate.\n    *   **Exclusions:** Renters (if selectable) or students.\n\n### Offline actions\n1.  **Digitize the Offline Asset:** You have 1 offline asset available. Take a high-quality photo or scan of this asset (flyer/banner) and use it as an organic social media post to support the paid ads.\n2.  **Strategic Distribution:** If the offline asset is a physical flyer/standee, deploy it in high-traffic residential areas in Ranchi (e.g., Morabadi, Bariatu, or Kanke Road) where homeownership is high, to create a \"surround sound\" effect with the digital ads.\n\n### WhatsApp & follow-up\n1.  **Deploy the WhatsApp Pack:** Ensure the \"WhatsApp pack\" (scripts/templates) is loaded into your Business App or CRM. The auto-reply for incoming leads must be set immediately.\n    *   *Draft Greeting:* \"Namaste! Thanks for choosing Dakshayani Enterprises. Are you looking for a Solar setup for your Home or Business?\"\n2.  **Speed to Lead:** For solar leads in Ranchi, trust is key. Assign a sales rep to call any lead coming from Facebook within **15 minutes**.\n3.  **Trust Building:** Prepare a PDF or image gallery of \"Recent Projects in Ranchi\" to send immediately via WhatsApp once a user engages.\n\n### Budget & optimization\n1.  **Pacing Strategy:** Do not spend the ₹10,000 all at once. Set a **Daily Budget of ₹500–₹700**. This allows the campaign to run for ~14 days, giving the Facebook algorithm time to learn.\n2.  **Cost Cap:** Monitor Cost Per Lead (CPL).\n    *   **Target CPL:** ₹150–₹250.\n    *   **Kill Switch:** If an ad set spends ₹1,000 without a single lead/message, turn it off and change the creative.\n3.  **A/B Testing:** After 5 days, review which of the 3 creatives (Trust vs. Savings vs. Subsidy) has the highest Click-Through Rate (CTR). Shift the remaining budget to the winner.",

        "last_ai_insights": "### Overview\n**Status:** Draft | **Risk Level:** High (Budget Dilution)\n\nThe strategy targets a high-value persona (PSU/Govt employees) with a strong pain point (running ACs/Geysers), but the **₹10,000 budget is insufficient to cover the proposed geographic spread** (8+ urban/semi-urban centers). Spreading ₹4,000 on Google Ads across Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, *and* secondary hubs will result in negligible impression share and zero meaningful data.\n\n**Strategic Pivot:** We must treat December as a **single-market pilot**. We will concentrate 100% of the spend on **Ranchi and Jamshedpur only**. Once we validate CPL (Cost Per Lead) here, we expand to Dhanbad/Bokaro in January.\n\n---\n\n### Online actions\n**Priority 1: Geo-Fencing & Exclusion (Google & Meta)**\n*   **Action:** Edit campaign settings to strictly target **Ranchi and Jamshedpur** urban limits. Remove Dhanbad, Bokaro, Hazaribagh, Deoghar, Ramgarh, and Giridih from this specific flight.\n*   **Action:** Apply negative radius targeting for \"deep rural pockets\" immediately to prevent wasted clicks from non-serviceable areas.\n*   **Rationale:** ₹10,000 cannot penetrate the whole state. Dominating two cities is better than being invisible in eight.\n\n**Priority 2: Google Search Ads (₹4,000 Allocation)**\n*   **Action:** Implement \"Exact Match\" and \"Phrase Match\" only. Bidding on broad terms like \"Solar Panel\" will drain ₹4,000 in two days with no conversions.\n*   **Keywords:** Focus exclusively on intent: \"Solar installation company Ranchi,\" \"Tata Power Solar dealer Jamshedpur,\" \"Solar EPC Jharkhand.\"\n*   **Ad Copy:** Highlight the specific pain point from the persona data: *\"Run your AC without the Bill. Solar solutions for independent homes in Ranchi.\"*\n\n**Priority 3: Facebook/Instagram Creative (₹5,000 Allocation)**\n*   **Action:** Update ad visuals to feature **local housing aesthetics**. Do not use stock photos of American suburbs. Show a concrete roof installation typical of a Ranchi colony (e.g., Harmu or Morabadi).\n*   **Audience Layering:** Target \"Government Employees,\" \"Indian Railways\" (for Jamshedpur/Ranchi), and \"State Bank of India\" interests combined with \"Home Ownership.\"\n*   **Lead Form:** Add a mandatory qualifying question: *\"Is your monthly electricity bill above ₹1,500?\"* (Yes/No). This filters out low-value leads before you pay for them.\n\n---\n\n### Offline actions\n**Priority 1: Sales \"Speed-to-Lead\" Protocol**\n*   **Action:** Since we have 0 offline marketing assets, the \"offline\" component is the sales team's response time. Instruct the sales team that online leads must be called within **15 minutes**.\n*   **Scripting:** Equip the sales team with a script that references the ad hook: *\"I saw you were interested in cutting down your AC costs...\"* rather than a generic *\"Do you want solar?\"*\n\n**Priority 2: Site Survey Readiness**\n*   **Action:** Ensure survey engineers in Ranchi and Jamshedpur are on standby. The goal for this campaign is to convert a digital lead to a physical site visit within 48 hours to lock in the high-intent PSU persona.\n\n---\n\n### WhatsApp & follow-up\n**Priority 1: Create Missing Assets (Critical)**\n*   **Action:** The data shows **0 WhatsApp packs**. Create a \"Solar Savings Calculator\" template immediately.\n*   **Message Draft:** *\"Hi [Name], tired of ₹2,000+ bills? See how much you can save by switching to solar. Reply 'CALCULATE' for a free estimate.\"*\n\n**Priority 2: Automation Setup**\n*   **Action:** Configure the ₹1,000 budget to trigger *only* as an auto-response to Facebook Lead Form fills. Do not use this budget for cold broadcasting (risk of number banning and low conversion).\n*   **Goal:** Use WhatsApp to deliver the company profile and past project photos (social proof) instantly after they sign up.\n\n---\n\n### Budget & optimization\n**Priority 1: Reallocation**\n*   **Action:** If Google CPC (Cost Per Click) in Ranchi exceeds ₹60, pause Google Ads immediately and shift the remaining budget to Facebook/Instagram, where CPM (Cost Per 1,000 impressions) is cheaper for this specific demographic.\n\n**Priority 2: \"Draft\" to \"Live\" Checklist**\n1.  **Reduce Geo-Targeting:** Ranchi + Jamshedpur ONLY.\n2.  **Upload Creative:** Local home images + \"High Bill\" copy.\n3.  **Create WhatsApp Template:** Auto-response for leads.\n4.  **Launch:** Execute immediately to catch the end-of-year tax planning crowd (PSU employees).",
